  DESCRIPTION
  Simple example for creating an audio transceiver by sending audio
  using the nRF24L01 RF transceiver module.

/* RF24 Audio Library TMRh20 2014

This sketch is intended to demonstrate the basic functionality of the audio library.

Requirements:
2 Arduinos (Uno,Nano,Mega, etc supported)
2 NRF24LO1 Radio Modules
1 or more input devices (microphone, ipod, etc)
1 or more output devices (speaker, amplifier, etc)

Setup:
1. Change the CE,CS pins below to match your chosen pins (I use 7,8 on 328 boards, and 48,49 on Mega boards)
2. Upload this sketch to two or more devices
3. Send serial commands via the serial monitor to control transmission and volume (volume only affects receiving devices)

Default Pin Selections:
Speaker: pins 9,10 on UNO, Nano,  pins 11,12 on Mega 2560
Input/Microphone: Analog pin A0 on all boards
